# Introducing Mintee.

An all in one NFT art market solution seeking to empower the NFT art community as a whole.


## The current problems with NFT Markets.

There are many issues within the NFT market space at the current time. The most obvious of which lies within the Ethereum network based markets, mainly being the extremely high gas fees to use the network at current time. While some networks have already solved this problem for the NFT space by implementing markets on the Tezos & Ravencoin blockchains as well as private sellers making use of the Cardano network, this has done little to fill in other gaps and create a single well rounded market that will bring NFT art markets to the mainstream art world. This is not to bring hate upon a single market place that has launched or to say that they have failed in some way. Places such as [] & [] are certainly pioneers in this industry and have continued to develop and innovate their platforms since launch and we respect all those trailblazers who have come before us greatly.

However there is still a great deal lacking from the space that we would like to see addressed and have been working in the background on solving some of these issues. Some of these issues includes very basic market designs with no ability to sort search or filter; read tags, categorize art by genre, artist, collection, or type; royalties are lost if token is removed from market place; tokens attached to market not wallet, issues with hidden/locked content, current smart contracts are not built for digital tokenized art assets & inability to transact between market places.

Many markets have only addressed one or a small portion of the issues, however those that have begun to work on improving the market place have made great headway and created valuable contributions to the community. However the majority of these solutions are relying on single technologies in a race to the top to secure that top spot of one blockchain being the go to for NFTs. Currently we see Ethereum dominate the market, and Tezos, Cardano & Ravencoin all competing to overthrow Ethereum as king of the NFT market. 


## The Mintee Solution.

We are looking to create an NFT art market that encompasses all types, styles & genres of art. This ranges from visual art to both digital and tokenized analogue art. The marketplace is able to create a profile with wallets from various blockchains that support NFT tokens. This profile will be tied to the wallet address and able to interlink with wallets for other blockchains. The artist will be able to mint any NFT token on any of the blockchains supported by the platform; which are currently Cardano Tezos & Ravencoin. The artist profile will be able to be sectioned off by art type, genre, and collection. This will function as a permanent artist gallery to display the artist work for life while linking to the transaction history of the token. Each section of the gallery can be hidden at the discretion of the artist. 

The front page of the market place will allow collectors to explore art broken down by types, styles and genres; that will change out which types of art are displayed on top via a random rotation schedule controlled by an algorithm. Each section will highlight new works from artists in its category selected completely at random from profiles that have not sold work yet, as well as a section to highlight top artists in the category. Collectors will also be able to fully explore each section and sort artists based upon popularity, new works, undiscovered artists, and search via tags.  We aim to be able to let the collectors have more control to fine tune their searches to find the art that fits their taste. This is inline with our goal to see more power to art creators and collectors both.

At the project's current stage artist will be able to mint NFT tokens using our customized smart contracts and policyIDs built on the Tezos, Cardano & Ravencoin blockchain networks. Collectors will be able to make offers, buy out right, and bid in auctions on an NFT token with any of the platforms supported currency. Artists will be able to choose to restrict their NFT tokens to the blockchain it was minted on or allow for transfer to one of the other supported blockchains. Buyer will be able to purchase using any currency and retain it on the blockchain of minting or have it transferred to any of the other supported blockchains within the ecosystem of the marketplace. How does this look in practice?

An artist mints an NFT token asset on the Cardano blockchain and allows it to be moved between blockchains. The artist listed the token for $100 USD worth of $ADA. A buyer wishes to purchase this token but only holds $XTZ. This buyer can offer $100 worth of $XTZ and when the seller accepts the $XTZ will be converted into $ADA and deposited into the sellers wallet. The buyer can then receive the token on either the Tezos blockchain, or Cardano, or even Ravencoin which did not even participate in the transaction. If the token is moved to another blockchain it will retain all of its data including the Cardano payout address for royalties. If the seller has converted this Cardano token to a Tezos token and then resells the token to another Tezos buyer the royalty percentage will be converted automatically to $ADA and deposited into the art creators wallet.


# Current state of the project.

**Working but Experimental State:**
NFT Minting Engine for Tezos Blockchain
Cardano-Tezos Token Swap Protocol – moving into modifying to work with coming Cardano smart contract system

**Working but not usable in project:**
NFT Minting Engine for Cardano Blockchain – This works but it is solely based upon the Cardano PolicyID system. Cardano is launching smart contracts soon and the focus is on building upon this system and not trying to implement a system that will phased out very soon.
Back-end test-net system running Tezos & Cardano Minters & Token Swappers.
In Development:
TIZ Smart Contract Proposal for NFT Art on Tezos
Cardano NFT Smart Contract
Token Metadata Permanency Protocol
Multi Wallet Authentication

**Development Beginning Soon:**
NFT Minting Engine for Ravencoin 
Token Swap Protocol for: XTZ-RVN, ADA-RVN

**Developers Needed to Begin:**
Front End Marketplace
Build API to integrate token transfer to other markets.
Bridge between Market UI, Token Minters & Swappers & Native Blockchains

**Future Plans:**
Integrate Ethereum Network – Waiting to see what all the coming Ethereum updates will bring to the network and when they will be implemented.


# What exactly is Mintee & how is it different?

Mintee started as a project to bring NFTs to the Cardano network and circumvent the growing gas-fees of the Ethereum network. As research began the project evolved to integrate other blockchains Tezos and then Ravencoin. From there we decided not to restrict ourselves by locking tokens to a single blockchain. This created the need to build an entire system from the ground up swap tokens between blockchains.

This is how I began to develop the Cardano-Tezos NFT Swapper. Of course this meant that the smart contracts would need to function identically to each other so that the tokens moved from one blockchain to the other so that no data was lost on the token.
The token swapper is the backbone of this market & the proprietary technology that will set this marketplace steps above the competition 

This also aims to open up diverse buying power to collectors and buyers. Since you can buy a token from any blockchain with any currency and collect the token on the blockchain of your choice. The goal of this is to create a buying and selling environment that is focused on the art and not what currency you are using and blockchain the token is on. 

We seek to empower creators and to help bring about a true decentralized market not only through our market but by building a system that is easy to integrate with any existing market place. The system will also allow for NFT tokens created within other NFT ecosystems to be converted to Mintee NFT Tokens built upon our custom smart contracts by its original creating artist. We will also open up our API so that other markets can implement our token swapper within their market ecosystem, this will allow any token minted in the Mintee Ecosystem to be swapped to the blockchain of the market you wish to sell your tokens on.

**Virtual Gallery Events** - I have designed a gallery system in Unreal Engine using its virtual reality components. This system will be used to host virtual reality art events for various promotion of artists or Mintee.

We are planning on opening stake pools on both the Cardano & Tezos networks soon, the profits from which will be used to sustain this project. Be on the lookout for these pools to open up and you can stake in these pools to help us earn passive income. 


# Funding & Expenses:

We have put in alot of work to source out the most affordable servers to host this project through its final development stages. We have calculated the lowest acceptable salary to use as a starting pay for our developers as the funding becomes availble, this must be a liveable wage. We are constantly seeking partners within the community to help offset these cost further in various ways.

Development Team:
* Core Developer Team Salary - 36,000/yr Full Time x6 216,000/yr
* Additional Developer Salary - 30,000/yr Full Time x4 120,000/yr

# Mintee Business Model & Mission Statement

We aim to create and maintain an NFT art market that is user friendly, versatile, diverse and affordable. 

This means low fees (always 1% fee on sales only to Mintee), we commit to working to maintain the lowest possible transaction & minting fees with each blockchain and adjusting our smart contract policies as needed. This also means you can expect us to be keeping an eye on all blockchain projects that unlock the potential for NFTs as integrating into our network. We also commit to building a platform that is user friendly and ensures that the transition to cryptocurrency and NFT tokens is as painless as possible for any artist looking to enter the space. Furthermore we commit to building an environment that allows all types of art to thrive in a non competitive manner.


#Q&A

This section will expand as questions about the project come in.

Q: Will this project be open source?  
A: Eventually this project will release most of the pieces of our back end functionality as open source software. This will happen as the code base is ensured to be fully functional as indented, thoroughly debugged & stress tested, and intensely pen-tested. Our proprietary software will not be released until after the initial full launch of the marketplace of course.

Q: How soon after the Cardano smart contracts update will you be ready to produce Cardano NFTs?  
A: We are working with the Cardano updates to testnet as they are released and already working to produce our Cardano smart contract, assuming a smooth update we should be ready to mint immediately.
